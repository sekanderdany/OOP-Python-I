'''
Challenge: Enhancing Car Functionality

Enhancement requirements for the Car class
Enhance the functionality of the Car class as follows:

Task 1: Modify the start method to check if the engine is already running and display a message accordingly.

Task 2: Introduce a turn_off method to deactivate the car. This method should check if the engine is running and display a message if the engine is already off.

Task 3: Modify the drive method to verify the engineâ€™s status before allowing the car to move. If the engine is not started, the drive method should display a message indicating that the engine needs to be started first.

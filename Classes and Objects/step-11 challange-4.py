'''
Implement Rectangle Class Using the Encapsulation

Problem statement
You are given a partially completed code of a Rectangle class in the editor. Implement the class by completing the tasks below.

Task 1
Implement a constructor to initialize the values of two private properties: length and width.

Task 2
Implement a method, area(), in the Rectangle class that returns the product of length and width. See the formula below:

Area=length×width

Sample properties
length = 4
width = 5

Sample method output
20

Task 3
Implement a method, perimeter(), in the Rectangle class that returns two times the sum of length and width. See the formula below:

Perimeter=2×(length+width)


Sample properties
length = 4
width = 5

Sample method output
18

'''


class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.__length = length
        self.__width = width

    def area(self):
        return (self.__length * self.__width)

    def perimeter(self):
        return (2 * (self.__length + self.__width))


obj1 = Rectangle(4, 5)

print("Area is", obj1.area())
print("Perimeter is", obj1.perimeter())
